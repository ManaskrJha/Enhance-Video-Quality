## Introduction
Video enhancement through super-resolution is crucial for applications requiring higher visual fidelity. This project employs a deep learning approach to enhance video resolution by upscaling individual frames using a pre-trained model.

The process involves the following key steps:
1. Load the input video and extract frames.
2. Apply super-resolution to each frame using a deep learning model.
3. Save the enhanced frames to an output video.
